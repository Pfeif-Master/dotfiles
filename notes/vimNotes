			below is from site NOTE: also need to install autoconf
				#sudo apt-get install git make autoconf g++ flex bison   # First time prerequisites
			git clone http://git.veripool.org/git/verilator   # Only first time

			# Each build:
				unsetenv VERILATOR_ROOT  # For csh; ignore error if on bash
				unset VERILATOR_ROOT  # For bash
				cd verilator
				git pull        # Make sure we're up-to-date
				git tag         # See what versions exist
				#git checkout master      # Use development branch (e.g. recent bug fix)
				#git checkout stable      # Use most recent release
				#git checkout v{version}  # Switch to specified release version
				autoconf        # Create ./configure script
				./configure
				make
				sudo make install
				# Now see "man verilator" or online verilator.pdf's for the example tutorials
